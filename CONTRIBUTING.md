# Contributing to polymarket-cpp

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This guide covers the local
build flow, code style expectations, and PR conventions used in this
repo. For security-vulnerability reports, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
— do **not** open a public issue for those.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Reddimus/polymarket-cpp.git
cd polymarket-cpp

# One-time: install build deps (Ubuntu 24.04 example)
sudo apt install -y build-essential cmake clang-format \
    libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libwebsockets-dev

make build      # CMake configure + Release build
make test       # Run unit tests (ctest)
```

macOS uses Homebrew (`brew install openssl curl libwebsockets secp256k1`),
Windows uses vcpkg (the CI workflow has the exact invocations).

## Development workflow

```bash
make debug          # Debug build with symbols + sanitizers
make test           # Run unit tests (ctest)
make lint           # clang-format --dry-run + cpp_auto_audit
make format         # Apply clang-format in place
make coverage       # lcov coverage report (Debug build)
make clean          # Remove build/
```

Always run `make lint` before pushing — the CI gates on both
`clang-format --dry-run` AND the `cpp_auto_audit.py` script that
rejects bare `auto` for local variable declarations (see Code style
below).

## Code style

- **C++20** standard. No exceptions in the public API where avoidable.
- **No `auto`** for local variable declarations. Spell out the type so
  reviewers can verify intent without IDE help. Carve-outs:
  - Structured bindings: `auto& [k, v] = ...`
  - Lambda closures: `auto callback = ...`
  - Iterator-like results: `auto it = container.find(...)`
- **Formatting**: `.clang-format` (LLVM base, tabs, 100-col limit).
  `make format` applies it.
- **Includes**: project headers first, then system headers
  (enforced by clang-format `SortIncludes`).
- **JSON**: use null-safe helpers from `models/common.hpp`. Do NOT use
  `j.value("key", default)` — it throws on JSON null in nlohmann/json
  v3.

## PR conventions

- Branch names: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `docs/...`, `chore/...`,
  `test/...`, `build/...`, `ci/...`, `refactor/...`.
- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
  `<type>(<scope>): <summary>` — e.g.
  `fix(ws): null-guard moved-from accessors`.
- Squash + delete branch on merge. PR titles become the squash commit
  subject — write them clearly.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` under `## [Unreleased]` for any user-visible
  change (new API, fix that consumers will notice, dep bump). Use the
  Keep-a-Changelog sub-headers: Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed.
- CI must pass on all platforms (Ubuntu 24.04 + macOS + Windows) before
  merge.

## Release process

Releases are cut from `main` via tag push:

```bash
# 1. Update CMakeLists.txt VERSION and CHANGELOG.md [Unreleased] → [vX.Y.Z]
# 2. Commit the version bump
git commit -am "chore(release): cut vX.Y.Z"
git push origin main

# 3. Tag and push the tag — release.yml auto-creates the GitHub Release
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Semver: bump MINOR for new public API, PATCH for fixes/docs/CI.

## Reporting issues

- **Bugs / feature requests**: open a GitHub issue with reproduction
  steps + the polymarket-cpp version (`polymarket`).
- **Security vulnerabilities**: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the
  private reporting channel.
